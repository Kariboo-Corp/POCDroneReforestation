## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Specifications

Reforestation is a critical issue that faces numerous challenges, particularly in terms of **automation** and **access to remote areas**. To address these challenges, Julien Geneste came up with an innovative solution: using drones to plant seeds directly in the ground. With this in mind, he proposed a **Proof-of-Concept** (POC) project with the aim of quickly creating a viable product.

The objective of the POC was to utilize a *DJI F550* drone and outfit it with a **seed storage** and **propulsion system**. The aim was to ensure that the drone could *accurately* drop the seeds onto the ground, while maintaining its *stability* and preventing any *disturbance* to its flight.

## üîé Implemented approch

With the aim of creating a functional drone capable of planting seeds, the team started by mounting the given *DJI F550* drone and integrating all the essential modules necessary for its operation. This included a GPS module for navigation, an antenna for communication, a flight controller for stability, and a battery for power.

After the *initial flight test* was successful, the team members divided the tasks among themselves. 

- The design and creation of the **seed cannon**, ensuring that it could effectively release the seeds from the drone. 
- Modeling and printing the necessary parts to **securely install** the device on the drone. 
- Testing and automating the different **electrical modules**, making sure that the entire system was functioning smoothly and efficiently. 

By dividing the tasks in this way, the team was able to make rapid progress towards their goal of creating a fully operational seed-planting drone.

## üìà Analysis of results

**Qualify** and **quantify** your achievements. Make measurements from your work, e.g.:

* **User tests**: Setup a methodology to test the efficiency of your project against users. It may use pre-experiment and post-experiment questionnaires. The most users the better to draw meaningful conclusions from your experiments. Radar diagrams are good to summarize such results.
* **Table of data**: Provide (short) extracts of data and relevant statistics (distribution, mean, standard deviation, p-values...)
* **Plots**: Most data are more demonstrative when represented as plots. 

Draw conclusions, **interpret** the results and make recommandations to your client for your future of the work.
It is totally fine to have results that are not as good as initially expected. Be honest and analyse why you did not manage to reach the objectives.
