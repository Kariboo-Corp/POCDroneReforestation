## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Specifications

Reforestation is a critical issue that faces numerous challenges, particularly in terms of **automation** and **access to remote areas**. To address these challenges, Julien Geneste came up with an innovative solution: using drones to plant seeds directly in the ground. With this in mind, he proposed a **Proof-of-Concept** (POC) project with the aim of quickly creating a viable product.

The objective of the POC was to utilize a *DJI F550* drone and outfit it with a **seed storage** and **propulsion system**. The aim was to ensure that the drone could *accurately* drop the seeds onto the ground, while maintaining its *stability* and preventing any *disturbance* to its flight.

## üîé Implemented approch

With the aim of creating a functional drone capable of planting seeds, the team started by mounting the given *DJI F550* drone and integrating all the essential modules necessary for its operation. This included a GPS module for navigation, an antenna for communication, a flight controller for stability, and a battery for power.

After the *initial flight test* was successful, the team members divided the tasks among themselves. 

- The design and creation of the **seed cannon**, ensuring that it could effectively release the seeds from the drone. 
- Modeling and printing the necessary parts to **securely install** the device on the drone. 
- Testing and automating the different **electrical modules**, making sure that the entire system was functioning smoothly and efficiently. 

By dividing the tasks in this way, the team was able to make rapid progress towards their goal of creating a fully operational seed-planting drone.

## üìà Analysis of results

At the end of the project, the drone is able to **fly properly** despite the heavy load added to the drone.
The cannon is functional and is able to propel plastic balls supposed to represent seeds.
The selection of the seeds is done in a functional way, there is an arrival of the seeds in the cannon which is done **one by one**.
However, the electronics are not functional and do not allow the onboard system to propel seeds in flight.

During the tests we carried out, we have made several observations :
- Projection speed of **30 km/h** at the exit of the barrel
- **Inertia** during the movement of the drone due to the load
- Solenoid valve not sufficient to throw the seeds hard enough

To conclude, we did not succeed in producing a 100% functional system. Nevertheless, this POC allowed us to see that a drone of this size was able to lift such a load. Julien Geneste, who was present during the tests, was able to make **many observations** that will be useful for a future project.
