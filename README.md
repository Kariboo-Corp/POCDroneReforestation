## 📄 This project in short

The project, led by Julien Geneste, the founder of Kariboo, consists of the creation of a **seed cannon mechanism** that can be mounted on a drone. This mechanism will consist of the seed projection and storage module as well as a drone guidance system and an algorithm that will find the ideal positions for depositing seeds on the ground. The objectives are to find a solution that will allow the seeds to be shot, with precision and without destabilizing the drone, and to put in place a strategy to maximize the chances of survival of the shoot.

This project was created in response to the many fires in Gironde and more generally in France.
